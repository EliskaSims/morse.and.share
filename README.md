# morse.and.share
Morse and share is a slightly unuseful Python code, that translates text to morse code, beeps out the morse code (turn the volume on!), sends the code via email and translates it back to text.

It also allows you to quit :o .

You will need smtplib, time, ssl and winsound package (which is installed automatically if using Windows). 

You might have a problem with sending the email. It is because you have not allowed less secured programs to use your email. Which is good, because allowing it is not secure! If you want to use the sending function of the code, I recommend setting up a new email address and enabling the function here: https://myaccount.google.com/lesssecureapps. 

You will also have to enter your email password to be able to send the mail, so don't be scared (it is what it is).
